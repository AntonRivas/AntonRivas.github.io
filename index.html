             <p>My name is Anton and I'm a 4th year Applied Mathematics student at <a href = "https://www.myucd.ie/courses/science/applied-computational-mathematics/"  target="_blank" >UCD</a>. This website was made by me using GitHub Pages in my spare time in order to showcase some of my work to people. While my degree has elements of coding, most of the languages used were learnt in my own time. The most common language I use is <b>Python</b>, but I've also worked in Javascript, mostly with React. If you click on the right you can see more of what I've done.</p>
