            Welcome to my personal site!

          <p>I'll be using GithubPages to host this site for convenience,
            this will serve as a way for me to add personal projects, notes and work on my programming skills.
          </p>
          <p>One downside of GithubPages is that I can't work on serverside applications (afaik).
            So for now, I'll be sticking to front end functionality for this website.

            <p>Hi!&nbsp; I'm a third year student at University College Dublin studying Applied and Computational Mathematics.<br>While my course is mostly tailored to studying
              physical systems there are also some programming elements in Python and R which I hope to show here in mini-projects.<br>The languages used to make this website though,
              were learned in my spare time.
