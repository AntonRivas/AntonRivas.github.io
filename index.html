          <p>I'll be using GitHubPages to host this site for convenience,
            this will serve as a way for me to add personal projects, notes and work on my programming skills.
          </p>
          <p>One downside of git pages is that I can't work on servside applications (afaik).
            So for now, I'll be sticking to front end things in this project.

            <p>Hi!&nbsp; I'm a third year student at University College Dublin studying Applied Mathematics.<br>While my course is mostly maths and physics based,
            there are also some programming elements in Python and R which I hope to show here in mini-projects.<br>The languages used to make this website though,
            were learned in my spare time. </p>
